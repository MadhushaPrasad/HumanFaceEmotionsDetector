**Repository Name:** HumanFaceEmotionsDetector

**Description:**

Welcome to the HumanFaceEmotionsDetector repository! This GitHub project chronicles my fascinating journey of crafting a
bespoke image classifier from the ground up, leveraging the power of Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.

üöÄ **Project Overview:**

This repository is the culmination of my endeavors in the realm of deep learning, representing the fourth-year
assignment for a Deep Learning module. As part of this exciting venture, I delved deep into the intricate workings
of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The objective was to create a robust image classifier
without leaning on pre-trained models or external libraries, fostering a profound understanding of the core concepts.

üåü **Key Features:**

Here's a glimpse of what this project has to offer:

1. **Install Dependencies and Setup**: Get started effortlessly by setting up the required dependencies.

2. **Remove Dodgy Images**: Weed out any questionable or irrelevant images from your dataset.

3. **Load Data**: Streamline the data loading process to ensure seamless model training.

4. **Scale Data**: Preprocess your data by scaling it appropriately for model ingestion.

5. **Split Data**: Divide your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.

6. **Build Deep Learning Model**: Create your own custom deep learning model tailored to your specific needs.

7. **Train**: Train your model with precision and monitor its progress.

8. **Plot Performance**: Visualize the performance of your model with informative plots and graphs.

9. **Evaluate**: Assess the model's accuracy, precision, and recall to gauge its effectiveness.

10. **Test**: Put your model to the test with real-world data to see how well it performs.

11. **Save the Model**: Preserve your trained model for future use and deployment.

Join me on this thrilling journey of building an image classifier from scratch. Feel free to explore the code,
experiment with the model, and contribute to this repository. Together, we can uncover the depths of deep learning and
create something extraordinary!

üë®‚Äçüíª Happy coding!
